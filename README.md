# Division Online Self-Hosted Server
## Description
This is the self-hosted server alternative for the Online Division ecosystem.
## Installation
Installing the server is as easy as cloning the repo. There are some dependencies you have to keep in mind and install on your own.
```sh
$ git clone 'https://github.com/onlinedi-vision/odsh-server.git'
```
This server is written with the intention to be ran as root and installed at '/root/od-official-server'. With a logs directory and a cdn directory as described below.
Also the admin of this server must set certain Environment Variables before running the ```build.sh``` script.
A more complete installation would look like this:
```sh
$ mkdir /root/od-logs /root/cdn /root/od-official-server
$ cd /root/od-official-server
$ git clone 'https://github.com/onlinedi-vision/od-official-server.git'
```
The server's database is ScyllaDB as such this must also be installed and setup. More info about the installation can be found within ScyllaDB's [official docs](https://opensource.docs.scylladb.com/stable/getting-started/install-scylla/index.html).
## Environment Variables
Make sure to set the following environment variables before running the '''build.sh''' script.
```sh
 $ export SCYLLA_CASSANDRA_PASSWORD="the password of the 'cassandra' superuser of the scylladb instance"
```
## Usage
After installing the server and setting up the env vars and ScyllaDB, running it should be easy, from within the cloned directory:
```
$ build.sh
```
This will build and run the server.
